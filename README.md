Project Name: Book-it!

Book-it! is my "breakable toy" for Launch Academy. It's a personal library app that allows you to search over 25 million books by title, authors, topic, book genres using the Google Books API and save them to your own personal library. Book-it also provides link to the New York Times review from the New York Times API and brings in reader reviews from the GoodReads Api.

Author:
